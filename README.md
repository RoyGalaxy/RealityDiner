# RealityDiner

RealityDiner is a full-stack application designed to provide a modern and interactive dining experience. It includes separate interfaces for customers, restaurant administration, and super administration, along with a robust backend server.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **`client/`**: Contains the frontend application for customers. This is likely where users browse menus, place orders, and interact with restaurant services.
- **`admin/`**: Contains the frontend application for restaurant administrators. This interface is used for managing restaurant-specific settings, orders, menus, etc.
- **`superAdmin/`**: Contains the frontend application for super administrators. This interface is likely used for overseeing multiple restaurants, managing system-wide settings, and user accounts.
- **`server/`**: Contains the backend API and business logic for the entire application. It handles data storage, authentication, and serves requests from all frontend applications.

## Key Features (Inferred)

Based on the project structure, the application likely includes the following features:

### Client Application
- User registration and login
- Browsing restaurant menus
- Adding items to a cart
- Placing orders
- Viewing order history
- Potentially 3D model viewing for menu items (inferred from `server/public/model3d`)

### Admin Application
- Managing restaurant profile and details
- Menu management (adding, updating, deleting items)
- Order management (viewing, updating order status)
- Viewing sales metrics and reports

### SuperAdmin Application
- Managing multiple restaurant accounts
- System-wide configuration
- User management (admins, potentially users)
- Overall platform analytics

### Server
- RESTful APIs for all frontend applications
- User authentication and authorization
- Database interactions (MongoDB, inferred from `Cart.js`, `Order.js`, etc.)
- Payment processing (Stripe integration, inferred from `server/routes/stripe.js`)
- Real-time communication (potentially, e.g., for order updates via WhatsApp, inferred from `server/routes/whatsapp.js`)
- OTP generation and verification for security

## Technologies Used (Inferred)

- **Frontend (Client, Admin, SuperAdmin)**:
    - React (inferred from `.jsx` files, `vite.config.js`, `eslint.config.js` typical of React projects)
    - Vite (build tool, inferred from `vite.config.js`)
    - Tailwind CSS (styling, inferred from `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`)
    - JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend (Server)**:
    - Node.js with Express.js (common for `app.js`, `routes/` structure)
    - MongoDB (database, inferred from Mongoose model files like `Product.js`, `User.js`)
    - Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)
    - Stripe API (for payments)
    - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication (inferred from `verifyToken.js`)

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, you would typically follow these steps for each part of the application (client, admin, superAdmin, server):

1.  **Navigate to the specific directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client # or admin, superAdmin, server
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Each part of the application (especially the server) will likely require a `.env` file with configuration details such as database connection strings, API keys (Stripe, etc.), and JWT secrets. Create a `.env` file in the respective directories based on a `.env.example` file if provided, or according to the project's specific needs.

4.  **Run the development server**:
    For frontend applications (client, admin, superAdmin), this is often:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    For the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start 
    # or
    node app.js 
    # or a script defined in package.json like `npm run dev`
    ```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted)

## Server API Endpoints

The `server/routes/` directory suggests the following API endpoints are available:

-   `/auth`: Authentication (login, register)
-   `/cart`: Shopping cart operations
-   `/colorScheme`: Managing color schemes (likely for restaurant customization)
-   `/download`: File downloads
-   `/metrics`: Retrieving metrics and analytics
-   `/migrate`: Database migration scripts
-   `/order`: Order management
-   `/product`: Product/menu item management
-   `/restaurant`: Restaurant management
-   `/stripe`: Stripe payment integration
-   `/user`: User management
-   `/whatsapp`: WhatsApp integration (possibly for notifications)
